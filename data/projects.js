From hearing their rough wishes and ideas, i created the app as it exists today with a fully functional front end and admin panel.', 'After research and idea mapping, i created a PostgreSQL database connected to a GraphQL API built with NestJS, which could retrieve, store, manipulate and send the needed data to the front end.','The frontend is built using ReactJS combined with Typescript and a heavy influx of Leaflet and Sass. The app is fully responsive and has a lot of features such as a map, a filter and supports timestamps and locations with images, audio files and mp4 files.','The Admin panel is able to fully represent all the data and is able to manipulate it. It is also built with ReactJS and Typescript allows the admins to use both CSV files and JSON files to import data into map layers.'],
